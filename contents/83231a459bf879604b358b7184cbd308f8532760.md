Summary

LightRAG is an advanced, cost-effective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that enhances document interaction by integrating knowledge graphs and vector-based retrieval for more accurate and context-aware responses compared to traditional RAG systems like GraphRAG.

Abstract

LightRAG is a state-of-the-art RAG framework that leverages knowledge graphs and vector-based retrieval to improve the accuracy and context of responses generated by large language models. It stands out from traditional RAG methods by building entity-relationship pairs, which maintain the contextual relationships between document segments. Unlike Microsoft's GraphRAG, LightRAG is designed to be faster, more affordable, and capable of incremental updates without the need to rebuild the entire graph. This makes it particularly suitable for dynamic fields where information is constantly evolving. The dual-level retrieval system of LightRAG ensures comprehensive answers by combining local, precise queries with broader global context, thus providing both detailed facts and overarching themes. The framework is also noted for its ease of setup, allowing users to clone the repository, install dependencies, and start querying data with various modes of operation, including the use of free and private models.

LightRAG : A GraphRAG Alternative.
==================================

How to Set Up LightRAG Locally?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have rapidly become essential tools for building intelligent systems that combine the strengths of large language models (LLMs) with external data. One of the latest breakthroughs in this space is **LightRAG** — an advanced, cost-effective RAG framework that leverages **knowledge graphs** and **vector-based retrieval** for improved document interaction. In this article, we’ll explore LightRAG in depth, how it compares to methods like GraphRAG, and how you can set it up on your machine.

What is LightRAG?
=================

LightRAG is a streamlined RAG framework designed for generating responses by retrieving relevant chunks of knowledge, using **knowledge graphs** alongside **embeddings**. Traditional RAG systems typically break documents into isolated chunks, but LightRAG goes a step further — it builds **entity-relationship pairs** that connect individual concepts in the text.

If you’ve heard of Microsoft’s **GraphRAG**, it’s a similar idea but with a twist: LightRAG is **faster, more affordable and** Allows **incremental updates** to graphs without full regeneration.

Why LightRAG over Traditional RAG Systems?
==========================================

RAG systems, by design, chunk documents into segments for retrieval. However, this approach misses the **contextual relationships** between those segments. If the meaning or context spans multiple chunks, it becomes difficult to answer complex questions accurately. LightRAG solves this issue by generating **knowledge graphs** — which map out the relationships between entities in your data.

Limitations of GraphRAG
=======================

GraphRAG, while innovative, is **resource-intensive**. It requires **hundreds of API calls**, typically using expensive models like GPT-4o. Every time you update data, GraphRAG has to rebuild the entire graph, increasing costs. LightRAG, on the other hand:

*   **Uses fewer API calls** and lightweight models like GPT-4-mini.
*   Allows **incremental updates** to graphs without full regeneration.
*   Supports **dual-level retrieval** (local and global), which improves response quality.

Keeping Up with New Information
===============================

In fast-changing fields, like technology or news, having outdated information can be a problem. LightRAG solves this with an **incremental update system**, meaning it doesn’t have to rebuild its entire knowledge base whenever something new comes in. Instead, it quickly **adds fresh data** on the fly, so answers stay relevant even in evolving environments.

Faster, Smarter Retrieval with Graphs
=====================================

By combining **graphs** with **vector-based search** (a fancy way of saying it finds related items quickly), LightRAG ensures that responses are not just accurate but also fast. The system organizes related ideas efficiently, and its **deduplication feature** removes repetitive information — making sure the user only gets **what matters most**.

Why LightRAG Matters
====================

Tests show that LightRAG significantly improves both **accuracy** and **speed** compared to older RAG models. It also handles new information gracefully, meaning you get up-to-date and context-aware answers every time. This makes it a game-changer for applications where quick, relevant responses are key — like chatbots, personal assistants, and dynamic search tools.

How LightRAG Works: A Breakdown of the Workflow
===============================================

LightRAG’s workflow is divided into **two main stages** — Indexing and Retrieval.

1\. Indexing Process: Creating Knowledge Graphs
===============================================

Here’s what happens when you index your data in LightRAG:

1.  **Chunking:** Your documents are divided into smaller chunks.
2.  **Entity Recognition:** The LLM identifies entities (like people, places, or concepts) within each chunk.
3.  **Relationship Extraction:** The model determines relationships between these entities, generating **entity-relationship key-value pairs**.
4.  **Knowledge Graph Construction:** These pairs are combined into a **graph structure**. Any duplicate nodes or redundant relationships are removed to optimize the graph.
5.  **Embedding Storage:** The descriptions and relationships are embedded into vectors and stored in a **vector database** (e.g., Nano Vector).

> **_Nano Vector_** _is the default database used by LightRAG._

2\. Dual-Level Retrieval: Covering the Details and the Big Picture
==================================================================

LightRAG uses **dual-level retrieval** — a combination of **local** and **global** queries:

*   **Low Level Retrieval:** Focuses on nearby nodes (e.g., relationships connected to a single entity) to answer **precise queries**. This pulls out precise details — like specific stats about electric cars or regulations.
*   **High-Level Retrieval:** Identifies overarching themes and connections across the entire graph. This focuses on broader topics.— like environmental trends or the future of urban mobility.

This two-layer search ensures that the system gives well-rounded answers, including both the **facts** and the **context** behind them.

How to Set Up LightRAG with openai and Locally: A Step-by-Step Guide
====================================================================

With Openai Models:
===================

Step 1: Clone the Repository
============================

To get started, clone the LightRAG GitHub repository:

git clone https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG.git
cd LightRAG

\# Or Install from PyPI
pip install lightrag-hku

Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment
====================================

It’s recommended to use **conda** or **virtualenv** to isolate your project dependencies:

conda create -n lightrag python=3.12
conda activate lightrag

Step 3: Install Dependencies
============================

Install the required packages using the following command:

pip install -e .

Step 4: Index & Run Queries on Your Data
========================================

For this demo, we’ll index **“A Christmas Carol”** by Charles Dickens:

import os
from lightrag import LightRAG, QueryParam
from lightrag.llm import gpt\_4o\_mini\_complete, gpt\_4o\_complete

#########
\# Uncomment the below two lines if running in a jupyter notebook to handle the async nature of rag.insert()
\# import nest\_asyncio 
\# nest\_asyncio.apply() 
#########

WORKING\_DIR = "./dickens"

if not os.path.exists(WORKING\_DIR):
    os.mkdir(WORKING\_DIR)

rag = LightRAG(
    working\_dir=WORKING\_DIR,
    llm\_model\_func=gpt\_4o\_mini\_complete  \# Use gpt\_4o\_mini\_complete LLM model
    \# llm\_model\_func=gpt\_4o\_complete  # Optionally, use a stronger model
)

with open("./book.txt") as f:
    rag.insert(f.read())

\# Perform naive search
print(rag.query("What are the top themes in this story?", param=QueryParam(mode="naive")))

\# Perform local search
print(rag.query("What are the top themes in this story?", param=QueryParam(mode="local")))

\# Perform global search
print(rag.query("What are the top themes in this story?", param=QueryParam(mode="global")))

\# Perform hybrid search
print(rag.query("What are the top themes in this story?", param=QueryParam(mode="hybrid")))

**Modes:**

*   **naive:** Standard RAG
*   **local:** Entity neighborhood-based retrieval
*   **global:** Broader, global entity relationships
*   **hybrid:** Combines both local and global modes

Thats Alright, But i want to run with free and private models How to do that?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can use ollama models for that as given in below code.

import os

from lightrag import LightRAG, QueryParam

from lightrag.utils import EmbeddingFunc

WORKING\_DIR = "./dickens"

if not os.path.exists(WORKING\_DIR):
    os.mkdir(WORKING\_DIR)

rag = LightRAG(
    working\_dir=WORKING\_DIR,
    llm\_model\_func=ollama\_model\_complete,
    llm\_model\_name="your\_model\_name",
    embedding\_func=EmbeddingFunc(
        embedding\_dim=768,
        max\_token\_size=8192,
        func=lambda texts: ollama\_embedding(texts, embed\_model="nomic-embed-text"),
    ),
)

with open("./book.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    rag.insert(f.read())

\# Perform naive search
print(
    rag.query("What are the top themes in this story?", param=QueryParam(mode="naive"))
)

\# Perform local search
print(
    rag.query("What are the top themes in this story?", param=QueryParam(mode="local"))
)

\# Perform global search
print(
    rag.query("What are the top themes in this story?", param=QueryParam(mode="global"))
)

\# Perform hybrid search
print(
    rag.query("What are the top themes in this story?", param=QueryParam(mode="hybrid"))
)
