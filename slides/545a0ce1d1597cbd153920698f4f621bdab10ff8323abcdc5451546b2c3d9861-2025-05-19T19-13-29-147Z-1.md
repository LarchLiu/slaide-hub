---

## 步骤 1: 选择代理

- **关键:** **不要**使用特定的教育网代理 (如 SJSU)
- **推荐:** 使用普通的代理

<div v-click="1">

- **示例:** 如幻灯片所示，IP检测结果显示普通代理水平

![](https://linux.do/uploads/default/optimized/4X/2/c/9/2c96a2762a56af8025b56136e99fcf1ec52985b1_2_690x403.png)

- **目标:** 配置好代理，为后续步骤打好基础

---

## 步骤 2: 使用指纹浏览器

- **工具:** AdsPower (免费版支持5个独立环境)
- **优势:** 每个环境独立，不易互相影响

<div v-click="1">

- **配置:** 
    - 内核: SunBrowser 自动分配 (教程中是 134)
    - 代理: 填代理工具的本地端口 (如 127.0.0.1:xxxx)
- **操作:** 配置完成后，启动并打开浏览器
- **配置示例:** 如幻灯片所示

![](https://linux.do/uploads/default/optimized/4X/2/9/f/29fdceb93d6fddc461c1c230cdd2a53fb96afe55_2_658x500.png)

subtitles: {"default":{"zh_CN":["接下来，一个很多人可能忽略的细节，","但教程里说了超重要！","就是在开始 Cursor 验证之前，","先把你的大学官网和","学生管理页面都登录进去！","比如教程里拿 SJSU 举例，","让先登录 one.sjsu.edu 和","cmsweb.cms.sjsu.edu 这两个地方。"],"en":["Next, a detail that many might overlook,","but the tutorial says is super important!","Before you start the Cursor verification,","log into your university's official website and","student management pages beforehand!","For instance, the tutorial uses SJSU as an example,","telling you to log into one.sjsu.edu and","cmsweb.cms.sjsu.edu first."]},"click1":{"zh_CN":["而且它特意提到，","要从第一个链接 one.sjsu.edu","进去访问你的学生邮箱，","SJSU 用的是 Gmail。","这样就把学校相关的","几个关键页面都提前准备好了。","目标是确保在 Cursor 验证时，","系统能关联到你已经登录的学校环境。"],"en":["Moreover, it specifically mentions that,","you should access your student email","by going through the first link, one.sjsu.edu.","SJSU uses Gmail.","This way, you have prepared the key school-related pages in advance.","The goal is to ensure that when Cursor verifies,","the system can associate with your already logged-in school environment."]}}
---

## 步骤 3: 登录大学官网与管理页面

- **重要性:** 超重要，为后续验证做准备
- **操作:** 在指纹浏览器中提前登录以下页面
    - 大学官网主页 (如 SJSU 的 one.sjsu.edu)
    - 学生管理页面 (如 SJSU 的 cmsweb.cms.sjsu.edu)

<div v-click="1">

- **操作:** 
    - 学生邮箱 (通过官网链接进入，如 SJSU 的 Gmail)

- **目标:** 确保在 Cursor 验证时，系统能关联到已登录的学校环境

---

## 步骤 4: 开始学生验证 (登录)

- **入口:** 访问 cursor.com/en/students

<div v-click="1">

- **操作:** 
    1. 点击学生入口 (如 "Apply now" 或 "Get Cursor for Students")
    2. 使用学生 `.edu` 邮箱注册/登录
    3. 从学生邮箱获取验证码完成登录
- **页面示例:** 如幻灯片所示

---

## 步骤 5: 开始学生验证 (填写信息)

- **页面:** 进入验证填表页面
- **填写:** 
    - 确保国家和学校选择正确

<div v-click="1">

- **填写:** 
    - 名字和生日相对不重要 (提示次数过多可更换)
    - **重要:** 最后的邮箱必须是你的学生 `.edu` 邮箱
- **页面示例:** 如幻灯片所示

## 步骤 6: 学校验证 (检查跳转)

- **操作:** 提交表格后，检查学生邮箱收到的 Cursor 邮件，点击验证链接

<div v-click="1">

- **关键判断:** 
    - **成功:** 跳转到自动进行学校验证的页面 (如幻灯片图5/6)
    - **失败:** 跳转到要求上传证明文件的页面 (IP/前序登录问题)
- **重点:** 这一步是成功的关键，若失败需更换代理或检查步骤3
