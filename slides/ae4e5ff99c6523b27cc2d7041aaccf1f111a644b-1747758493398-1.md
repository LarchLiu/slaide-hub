# 具体步骤 1 & 2：Google Play 操作


<div v-click="1">

1. **绑定支付方式：**
   将用于 GCP 验证的卡绑定到 Google Play


</div>

<div v-click="2">

2. **制造成功交易：**
   在 Google Play 购买低于 $1 的应用/书籍
   - 最初尝试：$0.49 App
   - 社区发现：**$0.02** 或 **$0.01** 电子书
     (搜索 "ड्रैगन घाटी", "अरनिया" 等关键词)
   - 目的：产生一张成功账单

# 具体步骤 3：GCP 激活

完成 Google Play 交易后，前往 GCP 激活赠金。


<div v-click="1">

**关键要点：卡内余额 ≥ $2**
- GCP 会进行小额扣款验证卡的有效性
- 确保卡内有至少 **$2** 可用余额 (扣款通常会退回)
