# 我的 "一次过" 方法

## 核心思路：Google Play 优先

避免直接在 GCP 激活赠金

先将支付方式绑定并使用于 Google Play

利用 GCP 自动检测已有支付卡完成验证

# 实操步骤 (一)

## 先搞定 Google Play

1. **绑定支付方式：**
   前往 Google Play 商店，在“支付方式”中绑定计划用于 GCP 的卡。

2. **产生消费记录：**
   在 Google Play 购买任意低价应用或书籍，确保交易成功。

**小贴士：** 可寻找低于 $1 的商品，如特定语言的几美分书籍（如原文提及的 $0.02 或 $0.01）。

# 实操步骤 (二)

## GCP 自动验证与准备

3. **回到 GCP 激活：**
   Google Play 消费成功后，前往 GCP 激活赠金，系统应会自动检测到已关联的支付方式。

4. **保障卡内余额：**


::right::

   GCP 验证时会进行小额扣费（通常会退还），请确保卡内至少有 **$2** 余额。

**我的配置：** 使用相对干净的美国 IP + infini 兔卡

# 总结与思考

## 核心方法：Google Play -> GCP

<div v-click="1">

## 关键因素：

- 在 Google Play 成功消费一笔小额交易。
- 用于验证的卡内有足够余额 (建议 $2+)。
- 相对干净的网络环境 (如美国 IP)。
- 选择合适的虚拟卡。

这种"曲线救国"的支付验证思路，还能应用在哪些场景？
